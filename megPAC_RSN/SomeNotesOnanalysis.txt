In the following the needed Skripts are listed. You need to run the scripts subsequently - as the results are needed for the next step.

1. in brainstorm bst_PAC: does the same thing as PAC_calculation.
Same frequency resolultion only when not used from brainstorm. Otherwise 
frequency resolution a bit different. Might not matter.
Datepreprocessing: Demean the source time-series and remove bad segments before PAC calculation.

2. megPAC_bst
high-frequencies from 80-150 and binning according to PAC_calculation hard coded
Could be changed if needed.
Datepreprocessing: Demean the source time-series and remove bad segments before calculation.
For this part you need brainstorm in your path (calls process_resample)

3. Before group analysis the individual results from megPAC_bst need to be projected to
default anatomy and demeaned.
Conv'*interp2.tess2tess_interp.Wmat';
The interpolation matrix will be saved in the anatomy of the individual in the brainstorm 
database - after the first time 1 data-file has been projected on the default anatomy
One has to make sure that this is the correct interpolation file, i.e. not another anatomy file!!


4. Group Analysis
