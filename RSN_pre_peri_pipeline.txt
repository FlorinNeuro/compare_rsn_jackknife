This pipeline is to redo the results for the comparison of the pre and peri RSN

A. determine and compare RSN
script based
1. MEG-PAC.m
2. megPAC_all.m
3. Rearranging_megPAC_MEG.m

by hand
4. Project Result from (3) on template brain in Brainstorm
5. Spatial smooth the result from (4) with 7mm in Brainstorm

Script based
6. RSpipeline_MEG_all_subjects.m for each condition
7. RSpipline_MEG_JackKnife.m for each condition
8. Take the RSN you find in all conditions in (6) and create a template set for each condition

by hand
9. select_RSN_based_on_Condition.m --> will find the matching RSN in each condition

script based
10. Jack_Knife_Statistic_based_on_PD_t_test.m --> run the test between conditions
11. prepare_RSN_JackKnife_statistics_for_correction
12. Create_images_of_cortical_RSN.m --> create images of the templates
13. create_template_Images_RSN_paper.m --> create the figure for the publication
14. Create_files_of_RSN_JK_statistics_both_template.m --> will create a summary file for the statistic results.
15. Create_images_of_cortical_RSN_JK_statistics.m --> create images of the statistics results
16. create_Statistic_Images_RSN_paper.m --> create the figure for the publication
17. Overlap_RSN_PD_HC.m --> calculate the overlap between the HC and PD jackknife RSN based on phi-correlation

B. Determine and compare PAC values/frequencies for each vertex and subject
script based
18. PAC_significance_MEG.m
19. PAC_MEG_group_analysis.m
20. project on template brain in brainstorm
21. Anova_PAC_frequencies_step1.m
22. Anova_PAC_frequencies_step2.m
23. Compare_RSN_UPDRS.m
